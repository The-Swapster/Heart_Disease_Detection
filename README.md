A comarative study of various machine learning algorithms on two datasets, i.e. uci heart disease dataset and cardio dataset, both of them were retrieved from Kaggle.
1) https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci
2) https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset

We used the skit-learn library of Python3 to execute this project. `
We used the following algorithms:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Naive Bayes
3) Multi Layer Perceptron
4) Decision Tree
5) Radom Forest

These models were used on the dataset, the dataset was divided in 80-20 ratio for training and testing the models.

The results of the dataset were visualised using Seaborn and Matplotlib. 

This repository was used for the preperation of the research paper titled, 'Impact of Machine Learning Algorithms on Heart Disease Datasets', 
published in the International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology.
